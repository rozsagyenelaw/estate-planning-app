│   ├── layout/
│   │   └── Header.jsx                # UPDATED - Added navigation

└── services/

```

## Technical Implementation

### Firebase Integration
- **Firestore Database:** Stores client data in `clients` collection
- **Firebase Storage:** Stores generated PDF and Word documents
- **Document Structure:**
  ```javascript
  {
    clientId: "lastname_firstname_timestamp",
    client: { firstName, lastName, email, phone, ... },
    spouse: { ... },
    trustType: "single" | "joint",
    documents: {
      pdf: "https://...",
      word: "https://..."
    },
    livingTrustDocuments: {
      livingTrustPdf: "https://...",
      livingTrustWord: "https://..."
    },
    createdAt: Timestamp,
    updatedAt: Timestamp
  }
  ```

### Routing
- Uses React Router DOM v6+
- BrowserRouter for clean URLs
- Route-based navigation
- Active state management in Header

### Search Algorithm
- Fetches all clients (up to 100)
- Filters client-side for case-insensitive matching
- Supports partial matches
- Searches across multiple fields
- Debounced for performance (300ms delay)

### State Management
- Uses existing FormContext for form data
- Local state for UI interactions
- Firebase real-time updates via service layer

## User Workflows

### 2. View All Clients
1. Click "View Clients" in header
2. See list of all saved clients
3. Use search to filter by name/email

## Testing Status

✅ **Build:** Successful, no errors
✅ **Dev Server:** Running at http://localhost:5173/
✅ **TypeScript/ESLint:** No errors
✅ **Code Structure:** Clean and organized
✅ **Firebase Integration:** Tested and working

**Next:** Manual testing with the comprehensive testing guide (see TESTING_GUIDE.md)

## Performance Considerations

- **Search:** Practical for up to ~100-500 clients. For larger datasets, consider:
  - Server-side pagination
  - Algolia or similar search service
  - Firestore query optimization with indexed fields

- **Document Generation:** Large complete estate plans may take 10-30 seconds to generate

- **Firebase Quotas:** Free tier limits:
  - 50K reads/day
  - 20K writes/day
  - 1GB storage
  - 10GB/month bandwidth

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Advanced Search:**
   - Date range filtering
   - Trust type filtering
   - Document status filtering
   - Sort options (by name, date, etc.)

2. **Bulk Operations:**
   - Export multiple clients to CSV
   - Batch document regeneration
   - Bulk delete with confirmation

3. **Client History:**
   - Version tracking for edits
   - Document version history
   - Audit trail of changes

4. **Notifications:**
   - Email notifications when documents are ready
   - Reminders for document updates
   - Client portal access

5. **Analytics:**
   - Dashboard with client statistics
   - Document generation metrics
   - Storage usage tracking

6. **Security:**
   - Role-based access control
   - Client-specific permissions
   - Document encryption
