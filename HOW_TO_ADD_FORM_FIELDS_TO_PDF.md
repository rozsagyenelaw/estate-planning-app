# How to Add Form Fields to Your PDF Templates

## üîç The Problem

Your PDFs have **text placeholders** like `${CLIENT_FIRST_NAME}` but **NO interactive form fields**.

**PDF libraries can ONLY fill form fields, not replace text.**

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

You need to add **interactive form fields** to your PDFs using Adobe Acrobat or PDFescape.

---

## üìù What Are Form Fields?

Form fields are interactive elements in PDFs that can be filled programmatically.

**Text Placeholder (doesn't work):**
```
This is the trust of ${CLIENT_FIRST_NAME} ${CLIENT_LAST_NAME}
```

**Form Field (works):**
```
This is the trust of [           ] [           ]
                       ‚Üë             ‚Üë
                 CLIENT_FIRST_NAME  CLIENT_LAST_NAME
```

## üéØ Pro Tips

### 1. Use Consistent Naming
- Field names are **case-sensitive**
- Use **UPPERCASE** with **UNDERSCORES**
- Match the names **exactly** as shown above

### 2. Test Your PDF
After adding form fields, you can test if they work:
```bash
node inspect-pdf.js
```

This will show you:
- How many form fields were found
- The names of all form fields
- If any are missing

### 3. Multi-Line Fields
For fields like addresses or lists:
- Make the field taller
- Check "Multi-line" in properties (Adobe Acrobat)

### 4. Save a Template
- Save your original PDF with placeholders
- Save a second version with form fields
- This way you can always go back and edit

---

## üöÄ After Adding Form Fields

Once you've added form fields to your PDFs:

1. **Upload the updated PDFs** to `public/templates/`
2. **Test the app** - form fields should now be filled
3. **Check the browser console** for:
   ```
   Found form fields: 50
   Successfully filled 50 out of 50 fields
   ```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Found form fields: 0"
**Solution:** You haven't added form fields yet. Follow the steps above.

### Issue: "Successfully filled 5 out of 50 fields"
**Solution:** Field names don't match. Check that field names are **exactly** as shown above.

### Issue: "Form fields found but data not showing"
**Solution:**
- Check that field type is **Text Field** (not checkbox, radio button, etc.)
- Make sure field is large enough to display text
- Check field font size in properties

### Issue: "PDF still shows ${CLIENT_FIRST_NAME}"
**Solution:** You didn't remove the old text placeholder. Use the eraser/whiteout tool to remove it.
