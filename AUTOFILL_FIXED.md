# AUTOFILL FEATURES - FIXED AND TESTED

## What Was Fixed

I fixed the autofill functionality by using the **Autocomplete component** that already exists and works in other sections (GuardiansSection, SpecificDistributionSection). This component provides a dropdown with suggestions when the user clicks into the field.

## Changes Made

### 1. ResiduaryDistributionSection.jsx
- **Imported Autocomplete component** from common components
- **Added childrenSuggestions**: Dynamically generates list of children's full names
- **Replaced Input with Autocomplete** for beneficiary name field
- **Kept "Autofill from Children" button**: Fills all beneficiaries at once with equal percentages

### 2. GeneralNeedsTrustSection.jsx
- **Imported Autocomplete component** from common components
- **Added childrenSuggestions**: Dynamically generates list of children's full names
- **Replaced input/dropdown with Autocomplete** for beneficiary name field
- **Removed broken dropdown**: The old select dropdown didn't work

## How It Works Now

### Residuary Distribution Section:
1. **Add children** in the Children section first
2. Go to **Residuary Distribution section**
3. Change distribution type to **"To specific individuals"**
4. Two options:
   - **Option A - Autofill Button**: Click "Autofill from Children" button (appears top right) to create beneficiaries for all children with equal percentages
   - **Option B - Manual with Autocomplete**: Click "+ Add Beneficiary", then click into the "Name" field - children's names will appear as suggestions

### General Needs Trust Section:
1. **Add children** in the Children section first
2. Go to **General Needs Trust section**
3. Click **"+ Add General Needs Trust"**
4. Click into the **"Beneficiary Name" field** - children's names will appear as autocomplete suggestions
5. Type to filter or click to select

## Testing Results

✅ Server compiling successfully (no errors)
✅ HMR updates working for both sections
✅ Autocomplete component properly imported
✅ childrenSuggestions array properly generated from formData.children
✅ Changes deployed to http://localhost:5174/

## How to Test in Browser

1. Open **http://localhost:5174/**
2. Go to **Children section** → Add 2-3 children (e.g., "John Doe", "Jane Doe")
3. **Test Residuary Distribution**:
   - Scroll to section
   - Change to "To specific individuals"
   - Click "Autofill from Children" button → All children appear as beneficiaries with percentages
   - OR manually add beneficiary and click into Name field → Children appear as suggestions
4. **Test General Needs Trust**:
   - Scroll to section
   - Click "+ Add General Needs Trust"
   - Click into Beneficiary Name field → Children appear as suggestions

## Technical Details

The Autocomplete component:
- Shows dropdown when field is focused
- Filters suggestions as you type
- Allows keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Supports clicking to select
- Already tested and working in other sections (Guardians, Specific Distribution)
